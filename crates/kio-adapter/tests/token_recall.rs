//! Does the text a page declares actually come back?
//!
//! `experiments/ocr-verification/fixtures/generated-images/ground-truth.json`
//! states, per input image, a token printed on it. Nothing checked whether that
//! token survives OCR until 2026-08-09, and by then a capture had been shipped
//! that loses its own token — `code-editor-no-crops.json`, whose
//! `G1-01-TOKEN-4827` is in neither `markdown.text` nor any `block_content` of
//! the 613 KB the service returned. A whole class of failure was going
//! unmeasured: the response parses, the shape is right, every count agrees, and
//! the words are gone.
//!
//! # Why this file has no per-capture code
//!
//! `real_layout_parsing_captures.rs` wires each capture in by hand three times —
//! an `include_str!` const, the `captures` array, and `FIGURES`. That is exactly
//! how five captures came to sit in this directory read by nothing while the
//! suite stayed green. Repeating that structure here would rebuild the problem.
//!
//! So this reads its inputs at run time: `capture-manifest.json` says which
//! captures exist and which input each came from, and
//! [`every_capture_in_this_directory_is_read_by_this_test`] fails if the
//! directory holds a capture the manifest does not list. **Adding a capture is
//! adding a row**, and forgetting the row is a test failure rather than silence.
//!
//! # What is asserted, and what is only printed
//!
//! The assertion is binary: does the declared token appear in `markdown.text`.
//! `visible_text` recall is printed and never asserted — the infographic loses
//! 18 fragments that are all chart-internal text, which is correct behaviour and
//! the reason `related_images[]` and `kio open` exist. A pinned rate would fail
//! on healthy variation and teach everyone to edit the number.
//!
//! `blocks` and `widest` are printed on the same terms, and for a sharper
//! reason: they describe the *cause* the token column only sees the effect of.
//! The one capture that loses its token is also the one whose page came back as
//! a single block covering nearly all of it — but that is one page, and one page
//! is exactly how S3-J's refuted rule got written. See [`block_spread`].
